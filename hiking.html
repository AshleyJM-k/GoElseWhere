        <h1>Best Time to go Hiking</h1>
        <p style="margin-left: 125px; margin-right: 125px;">If your looking to plan a trip to spend time hiking and exploring the beautiful places New Zealand has to offer the best time to hike is from mid-October to April. It is summer during these months and the days are longer and the temperature is hotter. The best time to plan a great walk of New Zealand is in mid-November. During the great walk season heavy rain or snow can liner and the alpines can make it impossible with snow. Keep in mind when planning a trip with hiking that the weather can vary and be unpredictable no matter where you go in New Zealand. Be sure to plan alternative activities when planning your trip. </p>

            <h1>What To Pack</h1>
            <p><b>When Hiking in New Zealand, you should bring with you:</b></p>
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li><b>First Aid Kit- </b>Just in case as you never know what may happen out on the trail.</li>
            <li><b>Garbage Bag- </b>All New Zealand national parks do not have garbage bins in them. So everything you bring in, you must also pack out. Don’t be a litter bug!</li>
            <li><b>Hiking Boots- </b>Its crutial to have hiking boots, especially for day trips. Weather varies in New Zealand and many trails can be snow covered, or muddy. To ensure your feet stay warm, dry, and comfortable bring your hiking boots.</li>
            <li><b>Hiking Poles- </b>On some trails, hiking poles can be very handy. It’s up to you if you’re comfortable hiking with them or not.</li>
            <li><b>Insect Repellant- </b>In parts of New Zealand, sand flies can be quite vicious. Insect repellant will be a massive life saver!</li>
            <li><b>Knit Cap & Gloves- </b>You will want a knit cap and gloves in your pack just in case the temperature drops. Always safety first on the trail.</li>
            <li><b>Layers- </b>No matter what time of the year you’re hiking in New Zealand, layers are necessary. The weather changes all the time. And, for those trails that gain altitude, it will get chilly. Wool layers help you stay warm or cool depending on the temperature. They also wick moisture away and prevents odors. A must when on the hiking trails of New Zealand.</li>
            <li><b>Pocket Knife- </b>You never know what you may encounter out on the trails, its important to come prepared for the worse.</li>
            <li><b>Rain Jacket- </b>You should always have a rain jacket in your pack even if it’s sunny when you start out.</li>
            <li><b>Sleeping Bag- </b>If you plan on camping, its a good idea to pack a sleeping bag. Even if you plan to stay in a hut along the trails its good to have a sleeping bag to stay warm.</li>
            <li><b>Sun Screen- </b>The sun in New Zealand is quite strong. Protect your skin by having sun screen, hat, head buff, and sun glasses.</li>
            <li><b>Tent- </b>Most trails offer huts or places to stay throughout the trails, though you have to book them months in advaces so its good to have a tent for an alternative option.</li>
            <li><b>Toilet Paper- </b>Though there are toilets on most of the hiking trails in New Zealand, not all have toilet paper. You’ll definitely want to have some in your pack with you.</li>
            <li><b>Torch- </b>For those early starts or trails with caves and tunnels, a torch is a must to have with you. I use this Black Diamond head torch and I love it, especially as you can control how bright the light is. And it seems to go on forever before you need to change out the batteries.</li>
            <li><b>Water Bottle- </b>Never start on a hiking trail in New Zealand without having water with you. And many trails don’t have a water source available. So, make sure you have plenty.</li>
            <li><b>Waterproof Backpack</b>(or protective outer liner)- You don’t want your belongings to get wet.</li>
            <li><b>Whistle- </b>The weather can change quickly in New Zealand. A whistle is a great item to have just in case of an emergency, especially if hiking solo. You’ll always find one in my pack.</li>
            <li><b>Wool Socks- </b>Not only are wool socks great for keeping your feet warm, they help regulate your temperature and keep the feet moisture free.</li>
            <li><b>Additional- </b>hats, sun glasses, lighters & matches, food/pots/utensils, </li>
        </ul>

                    <p>Explore forest walks that lead to a series of beautiful and breathtaking waterfalls, the Tutea Caves and Hinemoa’s Steps.Okere river, or also known as the ‘place of drifting’ plummets and scurries through a steep forested ravine before it enters the calm waters of the trout pool, which is a beautiful fishing spot where trout can be seen swimming against the current. Walking these trails in the reserve lead to four different and unique waterfalls, the fite of Rotorua’s first hydro-electric station, the Tutea Caves and Hinemoa’s steps. These steps were carved into the rock face in 1970 and lead to the waterfalls with some caves that were once used by local Maori women and children to hide from the war battles. </p>

                    <h3>Putangirua Pinnacles, Wellington, North Island</h3>
                    <p>Walk to the spectacular Putangirua Pinnacles or further for excellent views of Palliser Bay and Lake Onoke – the shorter options are suitable for kids.Around 7 million years ago this range was an island but as the mountains eroded, scree and gravel were washed down to the coast where they formed a sedimentary layer. Over many years the Putangirua Stream exposed this layer of gravel to the erosive rain and many floods. Some of the sediments stayed together while others washed away which resulted in the Putangirua Pinnacles ‘an amazing collection of hoodoos’ This place was also the filming location for the third movie of the “Lord of the rings”. Despite this being a shorter trek it does not disappoint when it comes to views. There are three routes that lead to the Putangirua Pinnacles or the lookout and all start from the streambed. From this location you are able to take the loop track junction on the lookout or continue uphill for a longer walk to view the Palliser Bay and Lake Onoke.</p>

                    <h3>Rainbow Mountain & Kerosene Creek, Rotorua, North Island</h3>
                    <p>This is ranked Top 10 best hikes on the north island, forming the letter ‘Y’. The trails start on the same track, and then divert to their respective destinations. We recommend doing Rainbow Mountain first, then hiking back to the fork in the road and making the trip up to Kerosene Creek to the best free hot spring in New Zealand. The hike up Rainbow Mountain is a bit of a challenge, as there are a few steep ascents on your way to the summit. There are a few wonderful lookouts including one over a red cliff, look closely to see steam rising from some geysers in the mountainside! On top of the Mountain on a clear day you can see for miles. If you are a mountain biker, there are mountain biking trails along the backside of the mountain, which take you right to Kerosene Creek! In the Summer you’ll see blackberry bushes lining the trail go ahead and have a little snack! The hot springs are an entire river, complete with flowing current and cascading waterfalls.</p>

                    <h3>Routeburn Track to Routeburn Falls, South Island</h3>
                    <p>With soaring mountain peaks, huge endless valleys, waterfalls and crystal clear and calm lakes this track links the Mount Aspiring National Park with the Fiordland National Park. While this track might be shorter when it comes to multi-day hikes it does not lack diverse scenery. The highest point of the track is 1,255 meters above sea level, which in some places is unheard of. The part of New Zealand that the Routeburn track winds through has been shaped by glaciations into fiords, rocky coasts, cliffs, lakes and waterfalls. Bird watchers also love this place through the forest offer sections that house native tomtits, robins, fantails, wood pigeons and bellbirds and also the elusive alpine parrot. This is not a loop track and can only be walked in either direction, one track is at the end of Routeburn Shelter and the other is at the divide. It is recommended though to avoid this track between May-September when the risk of avalanches is high. The weather is also colder and daylight is shorter. Bookings are required for huts and alongside campsites.</p>

It is highly recommended to plan ahead and set out early. In the evening you can enjoy watching the seals swim, spotting birds, and diving into the water.</p>
